# [Build a Ruby Product for the Long Run][published url]
## Instructor: [Jos√© Mota][instructor url]

In this course you'll learn how to build a Ruby product for the long run. Taking several criteria into consideration, we'll build a three-stage product. Even though everything will be built in Ruby, it doesn't have to be that way, as we'll rely heavily on the standard of HTTP to help us glue each piece together.
